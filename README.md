# Tic Tac Toe

This project is part of the Free Code Camp's front-end track. I'll build a Tic Tac Toe game using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

## Functionality

- I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer.
- My game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again.
- I can choose whether I want to play as X or O.

## Technologies used

This app is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/). I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get it started.

For testing I used [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest).
